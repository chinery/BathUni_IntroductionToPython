    "## Introduction\n",
    "Last chapter we looked at a lot of examples of *expressions*, lines of code which can be *evaluated* to produce an output. We also looked at how the result of any expression could be *assigned* to a variable for use later. Assignments are examples of *statements*, lines of code which *do something* other than producing values, which is the only thing an expression does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code we've seen so far is basically a glorified calculator. We can write expressions which make complex calculations, and can store these results in variables, but computer programs do much more than that... where is the *logic*? That is the focus of this chapter.\n",

    "### Functions\n",
    "A **function** is a *named block of code*. We often find ourselves needing to do the same thing multiple times in a program, and functions enable us to write many lines of code one time, then run them multiple times, possibly in many different parts of our program. We refer to running a function as **calling** the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function may (but does not have to) take *inputs* and produce an *output*. The inputs are called **parameters** or **arguments**, and the outputs are called **return values**. We say that we **pass in** the arguments, and that the function **returns** certain values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the syntax for calling a function is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "function_name(arg_1, arg_2, arg_3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this look familiar? It should! You have seen some examples of functions already before such as `type`, `len`, and `round`. Let's focus on `round` for a second. Here is another example of its use:"
