    "### Functional Programming\n",
    "We have taken a short surface-level journey through the history of programming paradigms, in a *very* loose chronological order of when they were invented or popular. First we have *scripts*, code with little structure at all. Then we have *procedural programming*, where *data structures* are used and passed between *procedures* to manipulate them. Then we talked about *object-oriented programming*, where *data* and *functionality* are combined into *objects*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional programming** is somewhat tangential to the other paradigms. It has been around a long time, as long as the early procedural languages. In fact, you might argue that functional programming has grown along an entirely separate, parallel branch of computer science. Algorithms today are normally designed around a certain sequential manipulation of data that was formally defined by the [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine). The Turing machine itself was invented by Alan Turing to solve [a mathematical problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem), but he was actually beaten to this goal by a few months by Alonzo Church, who used his own description of an algorithm: [the lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). The lambda calculus is the origin of functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a long history as a somewhat “alternative” to other programming paradigms. But functional programming concepts are increasingly becoming popular in non-functional languages, like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions as Computation\n",
    "We are already familiar with the concept of functions. Do you remember the difference between a function and a procedure? A function always returns a value, and procedure does not. If a procedure does not return a value, that means it must be able to *do something else*. It might change the value of some object that is passed in, or it might interact with the “outside world” somehow: it might print something to the screen, connect to the Internet, or turn on your printer. All of the things a procedure can do that *aren't* returning a value are called **side-effects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is concerned with **pure functions**. Functions that do not have side-effects, and are also not influenced by the external state in any way: the function always behaves the same way for a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interesting thing, and the connection with the lambda calculus, is that it is possible to write any Turing-complete program (algorithm) by using only pure functions and recursion. Literally! A programming language does not need to provide any other features: numbers, if statements, equality tests... none of it. Just functions, and the ability to apply functions to other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional languages are not *this* stark. They do provide the nice features we expect. Good functional code uses a lot of lists, function application, and recursion (specifically tail recursion: a concept not found in Python but is interesting to read up on).\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all well and good, but let's look at what this really means for Python development.\n",
