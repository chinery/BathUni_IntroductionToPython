    "### Data Plus Actions\n",
    "In the last section we showed how it was possible to create our own data structures using a library of procedures which performed specific tasks. But the *procedural* technique failed to properly unite data and actions. We showed an example using a stack, but there are lots of situations where we might want to unify these two things within a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are writing a game. You might have a number of characters who all have their own data e.g. HP, attack damage, and actions e.g. cast spell, move location. If each character can be a single variable which contains all of these elements then it will greatly simplify our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you are writing an point of sale system for a shop selling books and films. Different items in the same category share some features, all books have authors, titles, and ISBNs, all films have directors, titles, and cast details. But items in different categories might also share features: all items in your shop have a price, stock level, and distributor. Also, there maybe certain features which all items share, but vary in their exact implementation: all items have a VAT rate, but the VAT rate for books is 0%, while the VAT rate for films is 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have to be so physical, either. Many of the programming tools we use combine these things. We saw in [Section 5.2](../Chapter%205/5.2.ipynb) that we could create `streams`. One stream might connect to a file, another stream might connect over a network. The stream has some data e.g. the file location, or the IP address; and it has some actions, such as `.read()` and `.write()`, the exact specification of which depends on the type of stream you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are skirting around an idea here, so let's finally make it explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects\n",
    "An **object** is a structure that combines data and functionality. We used this term ages ago in [Section 2.1](../Chapter%202/2.1.ipynb), now we will be more specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every variable and literal in Python is an object. But it is slightly easier to explain what an object *is* if we can give an example of something that *is not* an object. So let's borrow another programming language: Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Java there are two forms of integer. When we declare a variable we must write the type before the variable's name. Take a look at this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int primitive = 10;\n",
    "Integer object = new Integer(10);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first variable is a *primitive* integer, the second variable is an *object*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A primitive:\n",
    "* Always has a fixed size in memory. An `int` in Java is 4 bytes.\n",
    "* Is purely data. All 4 bytes are used to store the integer itself, nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an object:\n",
    "* Can have a variable size, and a single object can grow in size after creation.\n",
    "* Contains data (attributes) **and** functionality (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "This last point is our key differentiator. In Java, only the object form can do things like this:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer object = new Integer(10);\n",
    "String string = object.toString();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which converts the integer to a string...! Okay... integer objects in Java do not have very many interesting methods. But I'm glad we mentioned strings. In Java a single character is a primitive. But a string is an object – it contains data (a bunch of characters) and functionality (various methods, like the string methods in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "char character = 'a';\n",
    "String string = \"abcd\";\n",
    "string = string.replace(\"ab\", \"cd\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`replace` is a *method* of this string object `str`. Hopefully this looks familiar: the exact same thing works in Python:"

    "The code above creates a string variable, then uses a *method* of that object called `replace` which *returns* a new string object which is then *assigned* to the original variable name. We covered all this in [Chapter 2](../Chapter%202/2.1.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "We said above that `replace` is a *method* that belongs to the *object*, and on this hinges our entire justification for introducing objects. But... *where exactly* is the code? When we created the string we provided the data, but we did not provide the functionality. In fact, *all* strings have the same methods. And each method, such as `replace` works essentially the same way on all string objects. If we were to write a `replace` function ourselves we might include some branching code, such as an if statement, but that function, that block of code, would not change from string to string.\n",

    "\n",
    "The classes for builtin Python types like integers and strings are very complicated and written in C code. So let's write our own class for the stack data structure that we made a procedural version of [in the previous section](6.1.ipynb).\n",

    "A few things to note here:\n",
    "* `def`\n",
    " * We create a method inside a class by using a `def`, like any other function.\n",
    "* `__init__`\n",
    " * The constructor must have exactly this name, including the underscores, which are a syntax used by Python to denote names with special meaning so that you are unlikely to accidentally overwrite them. \n",
    " * (We saw this also with `__name__` and `\"__main__\"`.)\n",
    "* `(self, size)`\n",
    " * The first parameter is called `self` – this is used in all of the methods in the class. \n",
    " * `self` exists so that methods can access properties of the individual object on which they are called.\n",
    " * When you call `my_stack.pop()`, the `self` inside the `.pop(self)` method code becomes a reference to the object `my_stack`.\n",
    "* `self.__contents = ...`\n",
    " * It is common for a constructor to set up the *attributes* (also called *fields*) of the object, this is the data that the object will store. \n",
    " * In this case, we create the array `__contents` and the integer `__head`. We store them “in” the object by writing `self.` before their names.\n",
    " * We can give them any names we like. But here we chose to prefix them with two underscores again. The reason for this is it makes the attributes *private* – we cannot access them directly from outside of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a demonstration of that final point. This demo class has a *public* attribute, which means it can be directly accessed from an object:"
