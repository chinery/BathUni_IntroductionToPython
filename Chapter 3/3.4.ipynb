    "Bugs are small, annoying things that are difficult to get rid of. The term is also used to refer to unintentional behaviour in software (\\*ba dum tsh\\*).\n",
    "\n",
    "People use the terms **error** and **bug** interchangeably, but *error* is somewhat more broad. There are many types of error, and dealing with errors is part of writing code – it is rare to get everything right on the first try, even for experienced programmers. Normally we fix the error immediately because it is obvious as soon as we try to run the code. Bugs are somewhat more subtle, and may avoid detection until the code is actually being used in real situations. We might have no idea what part of the code is causing it to misbehave, and the process of finding the problem and fixing the code is called **debugging**.\n",
