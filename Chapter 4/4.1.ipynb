    "We have often mentioned the importance of *types* in programming. Python is more flexible than many languages about typing, but it's still really important that you can always work out what the expected types are in any given situation. Sometimes it's the only way to make the code work: `\"Number \" + 1` will give an error, but `\"Number \" + str(1)` produces the desired result. A line of code might do many different things depending on the exact types, so keeping track of what type you expect a variable to be can make debugging much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the types we've used so far are what some languages might call *primitives*. While this is not a word used in the official Python documentation in this context, it is commonly used in other guides and tutorials. A *primitive* is an *atomic* data type – it is its own thing, you cannot break it down into smaller parts. In Python this includes integers, floats, strings, and Booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another language programming language called Java, *characters* are a *primitive* data type, and strings are made up of multiple characters. This makes the string a *composite* data type in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **data structure** is a composite data type where data is organised in a way that provides certain benefits – often speed or space efficiency. For some problems, a suitable choice of data structure can make the solution more efficient and easier to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, strings *can* be broken down into characters, but each character is just a single letter string. The *object* you get as a result of *indexing* the string is itself another string:"
