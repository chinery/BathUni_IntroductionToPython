    "## 4.3 Sets, Dictionaries, and Comprehensions\n",
    "### Data Structures\n",
    "A list is a classic example of a data structure. It seems so basic, you might think it should be a fundamental element in any programming language. But actually Python is the odd one out. Most languages have a similar structure called an **array** as a fundamental part of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Python lists, arrays in other languages:\n",
    "* always have a fixed size, they cannot grow to accommodate new elements\n",
    "* can only contain objects of a single type\n",
    "\n",
    "From a pure computer science point of view, there is another important difference. An array is a generally well defined structure, in terms of its *implementation*. It is a fixed size block of memory with sequential values of a particular type (and hence a fixed size). Arrays in C are basically the same as arrays in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a set of rules and concepts. The actual implementation of a list can be done in multiple ways. It is possible to use an array to create a list: whenever the number of elements goes above the fixed array size, you create a new array that is bigger and copy the elements across. You can also create a *linked list*, where each element of the list contains a reference to the next element. The implementation details can make a massive difference in practice. It is very fast to retrieve items from the middle of an array-backed list, but very expensive to insert elements into the middle. Linked lists have the opposite trade off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Java has at least 8 different [builtin implementations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html) of a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "This unit only skims the surface of the world of data structures. We are focusing on Python features, not data structures in the abstract. But the right data structure can make a hard problem easy, so keep that in mind when you move on from this unit to your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two more builtin Python features which mirror common data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "A **set**, like its mathematical namesake, is an *unordered* collection of *distinct* items. \n",
    "* *Unordered* means that there is no order to the items – sequences have a first item, second item, third item, and so on; but sets are just a collection of items in no particular order.\n",
    "* *Distinct* means that items are either members of the set or they are not, there cannot be multiple copies of an item in a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in maths, we use curly brackets to write sets:"

There are lots of unusual design decisions: whitespace (indentation in particular) is actually part of the language structure – this is very unusual in serious programming languages (sorry, I don't consider [Whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)) a serious programming language). When you are writing Python code, the *duck typing* can go between extraordinarily useful and maddeningly confusing depending on the time of day. \n",
    "\n",
    "But more than any of that, I think Python just has a lot of great convenience features, and it is part of the *style* of writing *Pythonic* code to use these when it aids readability. Examples include negative indexing, tuple unpacking, and **comprehensions**. \n",
