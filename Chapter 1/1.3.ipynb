    "```\n",
    "Question: what does this binary represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is... no idea! We can certainly *guess* at some sensible options. But the reality is we don't know what  format the data is stored in. This is where *type* comes in. If we know that this binary represents a positive integer, we can work out the number is 67. But there are many other possible valid interpretations. We mentioned before that `False` can  be stored as `0` and `True` can be stored as `1`, so this binary could also represent 7 Boolean values: `True False False False False True True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find the type of a particular value in Python using the following syntax: `type(x)`. In these examples we show the type of the number `10` and the Boolean `True`:"
