    "Programming, writing code, is the process of writing **instructions** in a structured format so that a computer can understand them and then follow them out (**execute** them). Most code also requires **data** of some kind, which is information that we store in the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: you might write a program that sends you a reminder a week before your assignment is due. Here are some *instructions* for this program:\n",
    "1. Find the current date (date1)\n",
    "2. Find the date of your assignment (date2)\n",
    "3. Check if the number of days between date1 and date2 is equal to 7...\n",
    " * ...and if so, show you the reminder\n",
    " \n",
    "This program would need to be run every day to work properly, but we are not going to worry about the different ways we *run* code until [Chapter 3](../Chapter%203/3.1.ipynb). For now we will tell Jupyter to run code for us in small blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice that the *instructions* for this program could be tweaked very slightly to solve different problems. We could track different dates (birthdays, holidays...) and we could change the number of days out that the reminder is shown. In other words, we can change the *data* without needing to write new *instructions*."
